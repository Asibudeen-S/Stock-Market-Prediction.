# Stock-Market-Prediction.
Overview:

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Machine Learning models. Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatility and non-linear patterns in financial markets. By analyzing historical stock data, we attempt to model price trends and generate predictions that can assist in decision-making.
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using popular ML techniques.

Features:

Fetches historical stock price data
Preprocessing and feature engineering (moving averages, volatility, etc.)
Implements machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, etc.)
Visualizes predicted vs. actual prices
Easy to extend for multiple stocks and timeframes

Tech Stack:

Python
Pandas, NumPy → Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization
Scikit-learn → ML algorithms
TensorFlow / Keras (optional) → Deep learning models (LSTM/GRU)
